<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Interstellar</h2>
    <p>
        This is probably my favourite movie. I love sciences, specially physics, astronomy and astrophysics. And of course, Hans Zimmer is my favourite modern compositor.

<h2>Inception</h2>
    <p>
        I love the concept of this movie, and Zimmer did another fantastic job for it. I like when the movie makes you think further.

<h2>Matrix</h2>

        Old classic.
